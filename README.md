# NCIt OBO Edition
This project aims to develop an [OBO Library](http://obofoundry.org)-friendly release of the [NCI Thesaurus](https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/). Goals include adopting OBO conventions for term identifiers and ontology dereferencing, as well as improved semantic integration with existing OBO ontologies. We are working in collaboration with NCI staff under NCI/Leidos contract #17X118.
